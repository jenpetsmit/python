# Web Crawler for YouTube Videos for the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive](https://www.youtube.com/@NLMNIH/search?query=sra)

Using a book from my library called, "[Mining Social Media](https://socialdata.site/)," I learned how to create a .csv of YouTube videos.  Coincidently, on my work project they wanted to know how many videos our project has on YouTube. I adapted the code to produce the .csv.
